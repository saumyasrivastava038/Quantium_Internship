# Conclusion

- Sales are highest for (Budget, OLDER FAMILIES), (Mainstream, YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES) and (Mainstream, RETIREES)
- We found that (Mainstream, YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES) and (Mainstream, RETIREES) are mainly due to the fact that there are more customers in these segments
- (Mainstream, YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES) are more likely to pay more per packet of chips than their premium and budget counterparts
- They are also more likely to purchase 'Tyrrells' and '270g' pack sizes than the rest of the population

Recommendation
The category manager may consider off-locating 'Tyrrells' chips in discretionary space near segments where young singles and couples frequent to increase the visibility and impulse behaviour

Conclusion for Module 2
It looks like the number of customers is significantly higher in all of the three months. This seems to suggest that the trial had a significant impact on increasing the number of customers in trial store 86 but as we saw, sales were not significantly higher. We should check with the Category Manager if there were special deals in the trial store that were may have resulted in lower prices, impacting the results.
